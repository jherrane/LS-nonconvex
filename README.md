### Disk-integrated brightness and radiative torque from Lommel-Seeliger scattering law for non-convex objects

The included code is a draft for the calculation of both disk-integrated brightness and radiative (due scattering) torque via radiation pressure on general triangulated shapes. The numerically exact calculation for non-convex shapes, which uses a method similar to z-buffering, is often bypassed for a speedup. The approximation does not produce significant error for shapes such as that of Eros (included in the repository), but is very likely to break for many more extreme shapes.

Future additions:

+  Analytic formulation for the torques
+ Mathematical formulation to this file
+ A binder for the scripts, to be used in the virtual EPSC meeting poster session
